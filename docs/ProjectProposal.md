# 8Hope 

## Application Definition Statement

*A clear high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to "What are you building?”. You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.* 

*Clarity over quantity should be the focus, to that end, creating visuals/charts to explain the more complex data or logical points could help to reinforce your Application’s Definition Statement.*

## Target Market

*Using Primary and Secondary research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

*Primary Research is research that you have conducted yourself and is not based on secondary sources. Examples of Primary Research include surveys, interviews, and focus groups. This doesn't have to be formal in nature and can include discussions you have with individuals that are likely users of your application. Secondary Research is research that has been conducted by others and is based on their findings. Examples of Secondary Research include market research reports, industry publications, and news articles.*

**Primary Research Findings:**
> Through two distinct focus groups, I gained valuable insights into potential users and their needs for the prayer watch application.
> - **Focus Group 1 - Women's Retreat** 
> - **Focus Group 2 - Siblings Seeking Purposeful Prayer**

**Secondar Research Findings:**
> I explored various online sources to gain insights into the concept of the 8 prayer watches. These sources provided valuable information about the significance of each watch, their historical context, and their relevance in modern spiritual practices.
> - Dutch Sheets Ministries: Dutch Sheets, a prominent figure in Christian ministry, has authored books and conducted teachings on the subject of prayer watches. His work delves into the importance of aligning prayer with specific times and seasons, drawing from biblical references.

## Use Cases

*A 'Use Case' describes how a user may interact with your application. It provides a series of steps to reach a desired result. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout, how many clicks would it take to do that? Begin with a simple question like that and then map out the different steps to reach the desired goal. Use cases help us think through how our application will be used.*

*Use Cases help drive design decisions as well as testing procedures. During development we regularly test and confirm the work in progress matches up with our Use Cases. This provides valuable insight into how our application is addressing the needs of the user and allows us to correct missteps early. This [article](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/use-case-testing/) gives additional background Use Cases and Use Case Testing.*

## Features & Functionality

*Define key features and functionality intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key items should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points.*

*A good way to identify a Key Feature is to use the phrase 'In order to [solve this problem] I need to [do this]'. For example, 'In order to listen to music while I workout I need to be able to create a playlist'.*

*Features and functionality should be prioritized based on their importance to the user. This will help you focus on the most important features first and then add additional features as time allows.*

[ Replace this text with a list of Key Features and Functionality for your application. Include a description of each feature and how it will solve a specific problem or pain point.
