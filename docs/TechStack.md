# Tech Stack

Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your final project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work? 


## Application Design

What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well. 

- **Figma**'s design capabilities are great for delivering polished, responsive, and well-documented web applications. 
- **Material UI** 
    - Built specifically for React applications.
    - Components follow Material Design principles.
    - Customizable theming and styling.
    - Active open-source community and regular updates.



## Front End Framework

List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.   

- **React**: The frontend will be built using React, allowing us to create dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.

## State Management

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).    

- **Redux** for state management - used to maintain and update data across your applications, and can be used as middleware to handle making API calls. 

- **MongoDB** - database layer - a NoSql database that is a cross-platform document oriented database program.

## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose? 

- I am a fan of the MERN stack so I prose to use Node. With Node you can run js on the server-side making it compatible with both frontend and backend development, its event driven, and suitable for real-time applications.

## Express

Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

- Express is great for routing and makes it easy to define endpoints and handling HTTP requests.

## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

A popular solution for relational database work is to utilize Sequelize as an ORM. Are you familiar with migrations, models, and seeding? What tools and solutions do you propose for your application? For example, utilizing an ORM to build out models with full validated CRUD.

- In a couple of classes we learned about migrations, models, and seeding. One thing I remember about learning Sequelize as an ORM is that Sequelize can simplify database interactions in a MERN stack to handle the management of the database relationship like the one between users and tweets. Providing a way to define and work with associations, where one user has many tweets or a tweet belongs to one user. Sequelize will use this association to simplify management of the database, making it easier to build complex data structures for MERN applications.
