# Tech Stack

## Application Design

- **Figma**'s design capabilities are great for delivering polished, responsive, and well-documented web applications. 
- **Material UI** 
    - Built specifically for React applications.
    - Components follow Material Design principles.
    - Customizable theming and styling.
    - Active open-source community and regular updates.



## Front End Framework

- **React**: The frontend will be built using React, allowing us to create dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.

## State Management

- **Redux** for state management - used to maintain and update data across your applications, and can be used as middleware to handle making API calls. 

- **MongoDB** - database layer - a NoSql database that is a cross-platform document oriented database program.

## Node

- I am a fan of the MERN stack so I prose to use Node. With Node you can run js on the server-side making it compatible with both frontend and backend development, its event driven, and suitable for real-time applications.

## Express

- Express is great for routing and makes it easy to define endpoints and handling HTTP requests.

## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

- In a couple of classes we learned about migrations, models, and seeding. One thing I remember about learning Sequelize as an ORM is that Sequelize can simplify database interactions in a MERN stack to handle the management of the database relationship like the one between users and tweets. Providing a way to define and work with associations, where one user has many tweets or a tweet belongs to one user. Sequelize will use this association to simplify management of the database, making it easier to build complex data structures for MERN applications.

# Change Order

* This document summarizes the proposed tech stack.
* Given enough time, I'd like to include a notification system that would alert the user if a friend or user is also praying doing the same time. Maybe something as simple as a green light on a know user list.
* List and describe any proposed changes to the original tech stack. 
- * I want to look more into state management instead of learning something knew with Redux. 

Keep in mind, approval is needed for proposed work and may include peer or instructor review(s). If you are unsure about your proposed ideas feel free to reach out to us for guidance.
