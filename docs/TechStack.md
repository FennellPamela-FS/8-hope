# Tech Stack

## Application Design

- **Figma**'s design capabilities are great for delivering polished, responsive, and well-documented web applications. 
- **Material UI** 
   - Built specifically for React applications.
   - Components follow Material Design principles.
   - Customizable theming and styling.
   - Active open-source community and regular updates.

## Front End Framework

- **React**: The frontend will be built using React, allowing us to create dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.

## State Management

- **Zustand** for state management - used to maintain and update data across your applications, and can be used as middleware to handle making API calls. 

## Node

- I am a fan of the MERN stack so I propose to use Node. With Node you can run JavaScript on the server-side making it compatible with both frontend and backend development, its event-driven, and suitable for real-time applications.

## Express

- Express is great for routing and makes it easy to define endpoints and handle HTTP requests.

## Database

- **MongoDB** - database layer - a NoSql database that is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.

# Change Order

* This document summarizes the proposed tech stack.
* If I have enough time, I'd like to include a notification system that would alert the user if other users are also praying doing the same time. Maybe something as simple as a green light or numbers of user currently online.
* List and describe any proposed changes to the original tech stack. 
The following changes have been made to the tech stack:

    1. **State Management**: Zustand has been added for state management. Zustand is a small, fast and scaleable bearbones state-management solution. It has a simple API and doesn't require boilerplate code.

    2. **API Integration**: The Bible API (https://bibleapi.co/) will be integrated into the application to access scriptures from the Bible. This will allow us to display relevant scriptures in our application.

    3. **Deployment**: Once the application is ready, it will be deployed. There are many services available for deploying MERN apps, including Heroku, AWS, and Vercel. The exact steps for deployment will depend on the service we choose.



Keep in mind, approval is needed for proposed work and may include peer or instructor review(s). If you are unsure about your proposed ideas feel free to reach out to us for guidance.
