## 📢 &nbsp; Weekly Stand Up

Each week I will summarize my milestone activity and progress by writing a stand-up. A stand-up is meant to be a succinct update on how things are going. Use these prompts as a guide on what to write about:

⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
<br>
🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
<br>
🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
<br>
🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

<br>
