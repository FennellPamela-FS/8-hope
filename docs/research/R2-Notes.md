## Sub-Topic 1 - Wireframes
Brief overview of research. 
Wireframes demonstrates a simple layout that outlines the specific size and placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas, and naviagtion for your website 

* 1: Wireframing is important because:
> - they display site architecture visually
> - allow for clarification of website features
> - push usability to the forefront
> - address scalability and ease-of-update
> - help make the design process iterative
> - save time on the entire project
> - demonstrates that the process works
* 2: Things to Avoid during wireframing:
> - **Avoid adding color.** Working in grayscale helps maintain focus on the primary function of the process, which is to finalize the layout, not the design. 
> - **Avoid adding too much detail.** too much in the beginning may add confusion. Keep the fidelity low and focus on making something that others will collaborate around.
> - **Avoid wireframing every single page.** Only do whatâ€™s necessary to move the project forward and get consensus before building.
* 3: Three Key Principles to go by:
> - Maintain clarity
> - Gain user confidence
> - Simplicity is key
