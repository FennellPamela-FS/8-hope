## Topic - R4: Delivery

- Mongoose and API endpoint integration

## Sub-Topic 1 - Mongoose and API endpoint integration
Independent research on Mongoose and API endpoint integration was instrumental in overcoming challenges. Resources such as the official Mongoose documentation, community forums, and review of previous coursework were particularly helpful. I would recommend these to future students for a deeper understanding of missed concepts as they relate to backend operations and frontend-backend communication.
