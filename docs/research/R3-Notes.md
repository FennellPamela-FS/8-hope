## Sub-Topic 1 - OWASP Top 10 Web App Security Risks
Security is a continuous process and not a one-time task. Therefore staying up to date with the latest security practices and threats.

* **1: Broken Access Control** 
    - Limit access based on roles and privileges. 
    - Never trust client-side validation and 
    - always perform server-side checks.


* 2: Cryptographic Failures (Sensitive Data Exposure)
    - Protect sensitive data during transmission and storage. 
    - Use encryption for data at rest and in transit, and 
    - ensure access controls are properly set up.

* 3: Injection
    - This includes SQL, OS, and LDAP injection. 
    - Always validate input, 
    - use parameterized queries or prepared statements, and 
    - avoid using user input in dangerous places like SQL statements.
