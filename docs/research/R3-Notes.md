## Sub-Topic 1 - OWASP Top 10 Web App Security Risks
Security is a continuous process and not a one-time task. Therefore staying up to date with the latest security practices and threats. The OWASP Top 10 is a widely accepted list of the most critical web application security risks. Here are some key takeaways from the OWASP Top 10 to revisit throughout this project:

* **1: Broken Access Control** 
    - Limit access based on roles and privileges. 
    - Never trust client-side validation and 
    - always perform server-side checks.


* 2: Cryptographic Failures (Sensitive Data Exposure)
    - Protect sensitive data during transmission and storage. 
    - Use encryption for data at rest and in transit, and 
    - ensure access controls are properly set up.

* 3: Injection
    - This includes SQL, OS, and LDAP injection. 
    - Always validate input, 
    - use parameterized queries or prepared statements, and 
    - avoid using user input in dangerous places like SQL statements.

* 4: Insecure Design
    - This is a new category for 2021, with a focus on risks related to design flaws. 
    - It calls for more use of 
        - threat modeling, 
        - secure design patterns and principles, and 
        - reference architectures.

* 5: Security Misconfiguration 
    - Keep all software up-to-date and configure them securely. 
    - Disable unnecessary features and use default configurations that deny access.


* 6: Vulnerable and Outdated Components 
    - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities 
    - Regularly update components and libraries, and 
    - consider using tools to scan for vulnerabilities.

* 7: Identification and Authentication Failures
    - Ensure that authentication mechanisms are secure and cannot be easily bypassed. 
    - Implement strong password policies, 
    - provide multi-factor authentication, and 
    - regularly update passwords.

* 8: Software and Data Integrity Failures
    - Insecure Deserialization
    - Be careful with deserializing data and 
    - consider using safer alternatives.


* 9: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures 
    - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring 
    - Implement logging for all events, especially login attempts and transactions. 
    - monitor logs for suspicious activity.

* 10: Server-Side Request Forgery 
    - often involves tricking the server into making requests to internal resources, 
    - bypassing security controls. 
    - Proper input validation and secure configuration are essential to prevent SSRF vulnerabilities.
