## Research and Development: R1 Notes

This document contains general notes related to...
- GitHub Workflows
- Creating Issues
- Discovery

<br>


## Sub-Topic 1 - GitHub Workflows
Brief overview of research. 

* 1: When using branches be mindful to fetch what's on your repo to sync with and update what you have locally.
* 2: Use `git fetch` then `git branch`
* 3: Understand how to apply the chart for  > | Branch | Pull Request | Who Approves |
* 4: Simplified Feature Branch Workflow Resource as refresher to this process.
* 5: Merge and Pull Requests (PR) are essentially the same thing. Merge locally, PR remotely.

## Sub-Topic 2 - Creating Issues
Brief overview of research. 

* 1. Working with Issues and Project views I discovered that you can select and then drag content from other cells to copy that data across multiple cells at once, very similar to Excel.
* 2. I also realized creating issues should be closely connected with actionable items that would be implemented.
* 3. You can comment and close an issue after marking it done to eliminate extra steps.
* 4. Using clear titles, and detailed descriptions helps explain the problem, assigning labels, and creating a label that makes it easy to identify what the issue is related to.

## Sub-Topic 3 - Discovery
Brief overview of research. 

As I went through the process of answering key questions to prepare for Kick-Off I discovered that I needed to:
* 1: Revisit and Confirm the Use of the Bible.API to make sure I can use it and then move the issue to begin implementation until next week. 
* 2: Developing the 30-second pitch requires a strict focus on a key feature that reveals a solution to the pain point that the app will solve (Purpose, Main Features, Benefit statement).
* 3: Although the idea and concept are outlined in the project proposal it still needs to begin development for project initiation.

**Resource 2: Git feature branch Workflow**    
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow): This site showed me how to understand collaborating workflows. 

**Resource 3: Elevator Pitch Examples: Crafting Your Perfect 30- Or 60-Second Pitch**      
[Teamly](https://www.teamly.com/blog/elevator-pitch-examples/#30-second_elevator_pitch_examples): This article explains that crafting a 30-second pitch is between 2-3 sentences and roughly 60 words. Make it short and make it memorable.
