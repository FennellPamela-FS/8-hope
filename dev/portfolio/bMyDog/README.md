## 📢 &nbsp; Milestone Check-Ins
#

### ⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week
**Topic and Theme:** Create a Pet Adoption App service for Dog lovers

**Prototype:** Created a Prototype of the App using figma 

**Library Tutorial:** Create a MUI - React Component Library Tutorial 
#

### 🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them
One of my primary challenges is time management. I am taking a course and I am learning a lot about myself. I need to leave or make room in my timeline for flexibility if needed for adjustments. One thing I've done to improve - I found a new workspace. Informed people that I will not be available at certain times. Asked to respect that and so far it has help a little.
#

### 🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week
My understanding of how the Milestones work to help build a TechStack. The more I work towards build a peice the better I can see how things are coming together.
#

### 🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next

Working on the Navigation and pulling from the Library Tutorial as a guide.
#

### Milestone 1
For this milestone you will have created a wireframe prototype in Figma.  Post your link here, so you have easy access to it. [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/uXPZcpyibr7vS53yJMav8E/Milestone-1%3A-Prototyping?node-id=2%3A2218)

#
### Milestone 2

What are the 4 pages/ views that you have built and how will they be used on your site?
- Main
> - Consists of User Login and will open to landing page. My thoughts here is to have routing that will start with a login to go to the landing page. Otherwise If I am not able to build the login, then this will open to a landing page as if the User is already logged in.
- User
> - A page that will access the user's settings and see a list of dogs they are deciding to choose from
- Search
> - A user will be able to search through pictures of dogs available for adoption
- Detail Page
> - A detailed page that describes full details about the dog, breed, and previous owner or current owner.
#
### Milestone 3

Please discuss the following:
API
- Link to the API that is used in your code [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)

>- documentation
>- I like the name Dog CEO
>- has a breeds list
>- pulls up a random picture of the dog

**Persistent Data**
-Discuss if you have used MongoDB or Local Storage and how it was used in your code.
>- I chose to Use MongoDBatlas to pull the data from the API and then consume that data with the Server
# Database: MongoDB Atlas
API and Web Server: Node.js
Frontend UI: React.js
